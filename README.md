This repository contains the main code for the paper "Beyond trade balances: three novel facts about current accounts"
(which also allows reproduction of the OeNB Working Paper 256 "Investment incomes vs. the trade balance: Is the current account still a meaningful concept?")

The analysis can be started right from 2_CAIIB_analysis.do; 1_CAIIB_datacr.do is mainly for documentation purposes.

.dta files required to run the code will be made available once the paper is accepted for publication.
